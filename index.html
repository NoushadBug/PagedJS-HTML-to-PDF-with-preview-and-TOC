            <p>This document consists of a Security Assessment Report (SAR) for Information System Name (Information
                System Abbreviation) as required by FedRAMP. This SAR contains the results of the comprehensive security
                test and evaluation of the Information System Abbreviation system. This assessment report and the
                results documented herein are provided in support of CSP Name Security Authorization program goals,
                efforts, and activities necessary to achieve compliance with FedRAMP security requirements. The SAR
                describes the risks associated with the vulnerabilities identified during the Information System Name
                security assessment and also serves as the risk summary report as referenced in National Institute of
                Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP) 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk
                Management Framework to Federal Information Systems.</p>
            <p>All assessment results have been analyzed to provide both the information System Owner (SO), CSP Name,
                and the Authorizing Officials (AOs) with an assessment of the controls that safeguard the
                confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data hosted by the system as described in the
                Information System Abbreviation System Security Plan (SSP).</p>

            <p>The purpose of this document is to provide the SO, CSP Name, and the AOs with a SAR for the Information
                System Abbreviation. A security assessment has been performed on the Information System Abbreviation to
                evaluate the system’s implementation of, and compliance with, the FedRAMP baseline security controls.
                The implementation of security controls is described in the SSP, and required by FedRAMP to meet FISMA
                compliance mandate.</p>
            <p>The FedRAMP program requires Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to use a FedRAMP-accepted Independent
                Assessor (IA) Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) to perform independent security assessment
                testing and development of the SAR. Security testing for Information System Abbreviation was performed
                by Third Party Assessment Organization in accordance with the Information System Abbreviation Security
                Assessment Plan (SAP), dated [Date].

            <p>A vulnerability is an inherent weakness in an information system that can be exploited by a threat or
                threat agent, resulting in an undesirable impact on the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, or
                availability of the system (application and associated data). A vulnerability may be due to a design
                flaw or error in configuration which makes the network, or a host on the network, susceptible to
                malicious attacks from local or remote users. Vulnerabilities can exist in multiple areas of the system
                or facilities, such as in firewalls, application servers, web servers, operating systems, or fire
                suppression systems.</p>
            <p>Whether or not a vulnerability has the potential to be exploited by a threat depends on a number of
                variables including (but not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The strength of the security controls in place</li>
                <li>The ease at which a human actor could purposefully launch an attack</li>
                <li>The probability of an environmental event or disruption in a given local area</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An environmental disruption is usually unique to a geographic location. Depending on the level of the
                risk exposure, the successful exploitation of a vulnerability can vary from disclosure of information
                about the host to a complete compromise of the host. Risk exposure to organizational operations can
                affect the business mission, functions, and/or reputation of the organization.</p>
            <p>The vulnerabilities that were identified through security control testing (including penetration testing)
                for the Information System Abbreviation are identified in the Information System Abbreviation SAR Risk

            <h3>3.3. Consideration of Threats</h3>
            <p>A threat is an adversarial force or phenomenon that could impact the availability, integrity, or
                confidentiality of an information system and its networks including the facility that houses the
                hardware and software. A threat agent is an element that provides the delivery mechanism for a threat.
                An entity that initiates the launch of a threat agent is referred to as a threat actor.</p>
            <p>A threat actor might purposefully launch a threat agent (e.g., a terrorist igniting a bomb). However, a
                threat actor could also be a trusted employee that acts as an agent by making an unintentional human
                error (e.g., a trusted staff clicks on a phishing email that downloads malware). Threat agents may also
                be environmental in nature with no purposeful intent (e.g., a hurricane). Threat agents working alone,
                or in concert, exploit vulnerabilities to create incidents. FedRAMP categorizes threats using a threat
                origination taxonomy of Purposeful (P), Unintentional (U), or Environmental (E) type threats as
                described in Table 3‑2 Threat Categories and Type Identifiers.</p>

            <p>Purposeful threats are launched by threat actors for a variety of reasons and the reasons may never be
                fully known. Threat actors could be motivated by curiosity, monetary gain, political gain, social
                activism, revenge, or many other driving forces. It is possible that some threats could have more than
                one threat origination category.</p>
            <p>Some threat types are more likely to occur than others. FedRAMP takes threat types into consideration to
                help determine the likelihood that a vulnerability could be exploited. The threat table shown in Table
                3‑3 Potential Threats is designed to offer typical threats to information systems and these threats have
                been considered for Information System Abbreviation.</p>

                <h3>3.4. Perform Risk Analysis</h3>
                <p>The goal of determining risk exposure is to facilitate decision making on how to respond to real and
                    perceived risks. The outcome of performing risk analysis yields risk exposure metrics that can be
                    used to make risk-based decisions.</p>
                <p>The FedRAMP risk analysis process is based on qualitative risk analysis. In qualitative risk analysis
                    the impact of exploiting a threat is measured in relative terms. When a system is easy to exploit,
                    it has a High likelihood that a threat could exploit the vulnerability. Likelihood definitions for
                    the exploitation of vulnerabilities are found in Table 3‑4 Likelihood Definitions.</p>

                <p>Impact refers to the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused to the system (or its data) by
                    successful exploitation. Definitions for the impact resulting from the exploitation of a
                    vulnerability are described in Table 3‑5 Impact Definitions. Since exploitation has not yet
                    occurred, these values are perceived values. If the exploitation of a vulnerability can cause
                    significant loss to a system (or its data) then the impact of the exploit is considered to be High.

                        V1-AC-2(2) if the vulnerability is for control ID AC-2(2). If there are multiple vulnerabilities
                        for the same security control ID, the first part of the vulnerability identification (ID) must
                        be incremented, for example V1-AC-2(2), V2-AC-2(2).</p>
                    <p><strong>Name:</strong> A short name unique for each vulnerability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Source of Discovery:</strong> The source of discovery refers to the method that was used
                        to discover the vulnerability (e.g., web application scanner, manual testing, security test
                        procedure workbook, interview, document review). References must be made to scan reports,
                        security test case procedures numbers, staff that were interviewed, manual test results, and
                        document names. All scan reports are attached in Appendices. Results of manual tests can be
                        found in 7.Appendix G Manual Test Results. If the source of discovery is from one of the
                        security test procedure workbooks, a reference must point to the Workbook name, the sheet
                        number, the row number, the column number. Workbook tests results are found in 7.Appendix B
                        Security Test Procedure Workbooks. If the source of discovery is from an interview, the date of
                        the interview and the people who were present at the interview are named. If the source of
                        discovery is from a document, the document must be named.</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> All security weaknesses must be described well enough such that
                        they could be reproduced by the CSP, the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), or the AO.
                        If a test was performed manually, the exact manual procedure and any relevant screenshots must
                        be detailed. If a test was performed using a tool or scanner, a description of the reported scan
                        results for that vulnerability must be included along with the vulnerability identifier (e.g.,
                        CVE, CVSS, and Nessus Plugin ID etc.) and screenshots of the particular vulnerability being
                        described. If the tool or scanner reports a severity level, that level must be reported in this
                        section. Any relevant login information and role information must be included for
                        vulnerabilities discovered with scanners or automated tools. If any security weaknesses affect a
                        database transaction, a discussion of atomicity violations must be included.</p>
                    <p><strong>Affected IP Address/Hostname(s)/Database:</strong> For each reported vulnerability, all
                        affected IP addresses/hostnames/databases must be included. If multiple hosts/databases have the
                        same vulnerability, list all affected hosts/databases.</p>
